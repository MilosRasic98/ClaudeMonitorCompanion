"""Print the Claude Code hook config for the mascot.

Usage:
    python3 tools/gen_hooks.py <host> <token> [--windows | --unix]

    python3 tools/gen_hooks.py 192.168.1.42 my-token

The platform is detected from the machine you run this on; the flags override
it, which is what you want when generating a config for someone else.

Use the board's IP, not its .local name. mDNS resolution was measured at 5.1 s
per lookup on macOS with no caching, which blows straight past the hook's 2 s
timeout and makes every hook silently fail. Give the board a DHCP reservation
so the address is stable.

Merge the output into ~/.claude/settings.json. It contains two top-level keys:
"hooks" for the mood events, and "statusLine" for the usage gauge -- the
five-hour limit percentage and reset time exist only in the status line's JSON,
not in any hook payload.

Two things about the generated config are load-bearing:

  "args" present  -> exec form. Claude Code spawns curl directly with no shell,
                     so the config is byte-identical on macOS and Windows. Shell
                     form would go through sh on macOS but PowerShell on Windows
                     when Git Bash is absent, and PowerShell aliases `curl` to
                     Invoke-WebRequest, which takes entirely different flags.

  "async": true   -> fire and forget. Hook handlers block Claude Code's agentic
                     loop by default with a 600 s timeout, so an unreachable
                     board could otherwise stall a session for ten minutes.
                     `curl -m 2` bounds the call itself so dead-board processes
                     cannot pile up either.
